1. Collected user_ids using selenium and different search approaches (search by university, keywords and [LinkedIn API](https://github.com/tomquirk/linkedin-api) from GitHub repository that stopped working after our attempts ðŸ˜…)

This data is stored in folder `user_ids_collection` in `*.csv` files.

2. Using retrieved user_ids collected the detailed user info using [StaffSpy](https://github.com/cullenwatson/StaffSpy).
