# Workforce Flow: Mapping Job Movements Across Companies

## Project Goal and Vision
The aim of this project is to visualize career transitions in the IT industry over the past decades. By tracking the movement of employees between companies and highlighting different occupa- tions, we want to provide insight into industry trends, labor mobility, and career patterns.


## Visualization Concept
• Nodes: Represent individuals in the workforce.

• Node Groups: Each company will be represented as a cluster of nodes.

• Node Movement: Nodes will change one company to another, showing career shifts.

• Node Color: Each job occupation will be assigned a distinct color (e.g., DevOps, Back- end, Frontend, ML, Analyst).

• Timeline Animation: The visualization will be time-based, allowing users to watch career movements unfold over decades.
